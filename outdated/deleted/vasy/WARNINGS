INFORMATION [Romain Lacroix 10/12/2008 09:47]

Pour obtenir cette liste de warnings, on peut utiliser la cible 'validation' du
makefile vasymake, comme c'est expliqué dans $sx/vasy/PROCEDURES, au point 5.4 :
"Cibles spéciales de vasymake".

Cette cible validation va appeler les 4 cibles suivantes :

 - cible all-compiles : effectue toutes les compilations possibles : 11
   combinaisons de differents compilateurs/architectures

 - cible examples : genere le code source des compilateurs dans le dossier
   trunk/examples, puis compile ces programmes

 - cible lint : appelle l'outil lint sur tout le code source de Syntax

 - cible bootstrap : compile Syntax pour l'architecture native, puis lance les
   outils Syntax pour regenerer le code source de Syntax (ces 2 operations sont
   effectuées 2 fois chacune)

(la redirection suivante est valable pour csh)

make -f vasy/vasymake validation |&  tee log | grep -vEi "(clock skew|in the future)" | grep --color -Ewi "(=>|error|warning|\*\*\*|ld.*fatal)"

Liste des warnings gcc qui restent dans l'état non-corrigé :

- dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules : 3 occurrences

lecl/src/pplecl_t.c:1236: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules
recor/src/pprecor_t.c:701: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules
tdef/src/pptdef_t.c:317: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules


================================================================================

Comment construire la liste des warnings lint "intéressants" uniquement :

make -f vasy/vasymake lint |& tee lint

cat lint | grep -E "(.c:|-bit|signed)" 

Ces 2 commandes construisent la liste des warnings lint qui vérifient les 2
types de problèmes suivants :

 - bitwidth (est-ce qu'on affecte des variables de taille X-bit dans d'autres
   variables de taille Y-bit, avec X>Y ?)
 - signedness (est-ce qu'on mélange des variables signed et des unsigned ?)
