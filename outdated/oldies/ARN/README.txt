Information given by Pierre Boullier : ARN is not a SYNTAX processor,
but an example of SYNTAX use. It analyzes ARN sequences. It is not a
classical example, because it is not based on CSYNT, but on the Earley
parser that can analyze general context-free grammars (thus, possibly
ambiguous) but in a cubic worst-time.
