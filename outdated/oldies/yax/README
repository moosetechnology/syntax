This directory contains a processor (yax) that accepts a BNF grammar
that contains semantic definitions "a la YACC" on top of syntactic
definitions "a la SYNTAX". This processor was introduced in version
2.0 of SYNTAX by Philippe Deschamp. It was seldom used and, in
practical applications, is often replaced by the TABC processor
(which is called SEMC at present).
