This example was provided by the VASY team (http://www.inrialpes.fr/vasy)

It is a small example of a compiler generated using SYNTAX for a small 
language describing chemical formulas. This example was written in the
late 80's.

The Makefile invokes all the necessary SYNTAX tools to build the compiler.

Some examples of formulas are given in the *.chimie files.
