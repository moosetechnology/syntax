This example was provided by the VASY team (http://www.inrialpes.fr/vasy)

It is a small example of a language tool generated using SYNTAX for a small 
language.
 
This example was written in the early 2000's by David Champelovier and 
updated in 2007 by Romain Lacroix.

The Makefile invokes all the necessary SYNTAX tools to build the compiler.

Some examples of programs are given in the *.petitlangage files.
