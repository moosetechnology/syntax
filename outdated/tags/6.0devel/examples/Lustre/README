This example was provided by the VASY team (http://www.inrialpes.fr/vasy)

It is a small example of a compiler generated using SYNTAX for (a subset 
of) the LUSTRE synchronous language. This example was written in the late
80's and, thus, is relevant to an old version of the LUSTRE language.

The Makefile invokes all the necessary SYNTAX tools to build the compiler.

Some examples of LUSTRE programs are given in the *.lustre files.
