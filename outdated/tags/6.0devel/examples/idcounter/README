This example was provided by the VASY team (http://www.inrialpes.fr/vasy)

It is a small example of a language tool generated using SYNTAX for a small 
language. The resulting tool prints the number of identifiers found in a
program, as well as various diagnostics when a identifier is read. 
 
This example was written in the late 80's by Jean-Michel Houdouin and 
updated in 2007 by Hubert Garavel and Romain Lacroix.

The Makefile invokes all the necessary SYNTAX tools to build the compiler.

Some examples of programs are given in the *.idcount files.
