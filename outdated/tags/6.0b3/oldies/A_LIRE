      Welcome to the growing club of the priviledged users of SYNTAX(*).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recommended use of this release's scripts:
	/bin/sh			# Else the scripts might not work
	DEST=/usr/local		# This is the default
	export DEST		# To be sure
	INSTALL VERSION		# If you are in the directory where this is
Answer "oui" to first question...

"DEST" must be set to an existing directory.  Binary files will be put into
${DEST}/bin, sources into ${DEST}/src, and so forth.  If you specify a DEST
which is neither "/" nor "/usr" nor "/usr/local", you will have to move or
link ${DEST}/lib/libsx.a (which is a library of object modules) to a suitable
place ("/usr/local/lib" might be best); the same may apply to binaries,
depending on the way things are usually installed on your machine(s).
The manual pages are in ${DEST}/doc/man, the tentative Reference Manual is
${DEST}/doc/syntax.gi.info, short help may be extracted from ${DEST}/doc/help.

After installation, if you are not satisfied with what you got, or need room:
	OTE VERSION		# `DEST' should still be set correctly
If you moved or linked things due to the preceding remark about DEST, you
must remove them ``by hand'' (whether before or after OTEing).

DO KEEP the contents of the cartridge in order to be able to use OTE on this
release when you will receive the next release (as OTE uses the contents to
remove the installed files).
