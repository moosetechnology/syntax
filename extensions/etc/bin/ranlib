# To be used on UNIX System V where ranlib does not exist.

# Changed by PhD on Thu Mar 17 1988 to replace "-x" option of "test"
# by "-f": some (dumb) shells do not have "-x", and after all, if a
# file exists in a "binary" dir, it should be executable...
#
# Changed by PhD on Mon Apr  2 1990 to extract files from the archive
# before calling "lorder": some (very dumb) "nm"(1) do not know how
# they should work on an archive...
