st_to_c:
	This tool generates a LECL-based scanner in C, whereas LECL normally
	generates a scanner that consists of tables interpreted by the
	sxscanner component of the SYNTAX library.

	The standard (i.e., based on tables) LECL scanner can be replaced
	by st_to_c. However, Pierre Boullier indicates that this has been
	done very rarely. The st_to_c approach might be faster, but this
	is unsure, and Pierre Boullier indicates that this was never tested
	thoroughly.

Notes:

1) The makefile rule for this tool should have the following form:

${L}_scnr.c: ${L}.st
	st_to_c.out ${L} > $@

2) When compiling the C code generated by tables_c, the following arguments
   should be given:

$(LIB)/{L}_t.o:  $(SXINCL)/sxunix.h  $(SRC)/${L}_t.c
        $(CC) $(SRC)/${L}_t.c                     \
                        -Dsxscanner=${L}_scanner  \
                        -Dsxscan_it=${L}_scan_it  \
                        -DSEMACT=${L}_act         \
                        -DSEMPASS=sxvoid

The -Dsxscanner and -Dsxscan_it seem specific to the use of st_to_c and
are usually not necessary when using "standard" LECL.
