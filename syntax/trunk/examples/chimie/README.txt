This example was provided by the VASY team (http://vasy.inria.fr).

It is a small example of a compiler generated using SYNTAX for a small 
language describing chemical formulas. This example was written in the
late 80's (presumably by Fabienne Lagnier and/or Nicolas Halbwachs).

The makefile invokes all the necessary SYNTAX tools to build the compiler.

Some examples of formulas are given in the test/*.chimie files.
