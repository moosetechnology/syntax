\- pretty-printer for abstract trees constructed by
SYNTAX.

#include "sxunix.h"

SXVOID sxatedit (node)
.ta \w'SXVOI'u +\w'SXNODE 'u
	SXNODE	*node\|;

SXVOID sxateditinit (file, md1, md2, pw)
.ta \w'SXVOI'u +\w'FILE 'u
	FILE	*file\|;
	long	md1, md2, pw\|;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I sxatedit
prints on some file the graphical representation of the abstract tree
constructed by
.B SYNTAX
(see
.BR semat (1)
and
.BR sxatc (3))
whose root node is
.IR node ,
using the generic tree pretty-printer
.BR sxpptree (3).
.LP
The output file and some other parameters must have been set beforehand by a
call to
.IR sxateditinit ,
with parameters as follows\|:
.TP
.I file
a pointer to the output file, which must have been opened for writing using
.BR fopen (3)\|;
.TP
.I md1
the minimum number of spaces between two sibling nodes (see the
meaning of
.I min_dist
in the description of
.BR sxpptree (3))\|;
.TP
.I md2
the minimum number of spaces between two non-sibling nodes (see the
meaning of
.I min_dist_on_subtrees
in the description of
.BR sxpptree (3))\|;
.TP
.I pw
the width of an output page (see the meaning of
.I page_width
in the
description of
.BR sxpptree (3)).
.LP
The type of the nodes constituting the tree, denoted by
.I SXNODE
above, must be
compatible with the type of bare nodes manipulated by SYNTAX, declared as
.B struct\ node_header_s
in
.I sxunix.h
(see
.BR sxatc (3)).
More precisely, it MUST contain a
.B struct\ node_header_s
as first component.
Note that this is the same general
requirement as when you use the other tools provided by SYNTAX for
manipulating those trees (see
.BR sxsmp (3)
and
.BR sxat_mngr (3)).
.LP
The labels of the nodes appearing in the graphical representation are defined
as follows\|: for a leaf node corresponding to some terminal token, it is the
text of that token, otherwise it is the node name as defined in the language
specification
.IB language_name .at
(see
.BR semat (1)
and the \fISYNTAX Reference Manual\fP).
.SH "IMPORTANT NOTE"
.I sxatedit
must be called in an environment in which the global variable
.I sxatcvar
(see
.BR sxatc (3)
and
.BR sxunix (3))
contains the tables of the language
to which the tree corresponds.
This is because
.I sxatedit
uses these tables.
Note that this is achieved automatically in most cases when you use the
procedure
.BR syntax (3).
