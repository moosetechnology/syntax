This directory hosts a few auxiliary SYNTAX tools generated using sxmake.
These auxiliary tools are mainly intended for debugging purposes. At INRIA
Grenoble, we never had to use these tools for developing our compilers.

check_bnf:
	This tool cross-checks that BNF works properly.

print_att:
	This tool presumably displays in text form the binary files produced
	by SEMAT.

print_bt:
	This tool displays in text form the binary .bt files produced by BNF.

print_ppt:
	This tool displays in text form the binary .pt files produced by PRIO.

print_rt:
	This tool displays in text form the binary .rt files produced by RECOR.

print_st:
	This tool displays in text form the binary .st files produced by LECL.
