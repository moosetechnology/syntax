"mix" is a tentative tool to automatically propagate changes whenever an ".at"
file is modified. Indeed, from a ".at" file, the SEMAT processor produces a
skeleton file (in C). The user must modify this skeleton file by inserting
hand-written code. When the ".at" file is modified, a new skeleton file is
generated. The "mix" tool was an attempt to propagate these changes to the
file modified by the user. However, Pierre Boullier is not sure that this
worked in all situations, so the mix tool was left aside, and is not used
in practice.
