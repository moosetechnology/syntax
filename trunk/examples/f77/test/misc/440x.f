cc FILE_NAME_SEQUENCE demonstrates ways of generating a sequence of filenames.
c
c  Discussion:
c
c    There are situations such as animations or parallel processing in which
c    it is necessary to generate a sequence of file names which include
c    an embedded index that increases.  A simple example might be
c
c      "fred0.txt", "fred1.txt", "fred2.txt"
c
c    A side issue arises when the number of files is large enough that the
c    number of digits in the index will vary.  Thus, if we are going to have
c    15 files, do we want to number them as
c
c      "fred00.txt" through "fred14.txt"
c
c    which means, for one thing, that they will alphabetize properly, or
c    will we be satisfied with
c
c      "fred0.txt" through "fred14.txt" ?
